//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let arrMovies = ['Bambi','Star Wars','Scooby Doo']
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let butts = arrMovies[0]
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let cheeks = arrMovies.length
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let thighs = arrMovies [arrMovies.length - 1]
